# Planorama

Planorama is a web app which lets the user track all of his work. It does the work of reminding 
the user of his work.

It generates a chart at the end to let the user know of his performance just at a glance.

The web app is made in such a way that people of all the age groups can elegantly use this web app.

The application is made using Python's Flask, sql alchemy as well as the jinja templates.


Currently, the project is hosted on the url: https://bhutkaryogesh.pythonanywhere.com/
